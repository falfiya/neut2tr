# Racket Examples

Racket files for testing.

- `awful.rkt` is a difficult-to-parse file used in development for testing if
   the `racket` module correctly identifies comments.
- `examples.rkt` is a compilation of types that should really parse.
- `homework_10.rkt` is a real-world example of NEUT
- `homework_10.t.rkt` is an incomplete manual translation of `homework_10.rkt`
- `test.rkt` is a typed/racket file for manual scratch work.
